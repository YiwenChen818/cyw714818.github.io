        <span class="v151_218">Please tell me specifically what ingredients you have in your fridge or take a photo for me.</span>
        <span class="v151_220">It looks great! I guess you are an international student right? I detect that you are in the Australia-Melbourne area. Is this location correct?</span>
        <span class="v151_221">According to the weather forecast, Melbourne's air is arid and windy today. Do you have anything to add about the weather?</span>
        <span class="v151_222">Based on your fridge ingredients, I'm guessing you want to eat the fish pie from the movie Kiki's Delivery Service, right?</span>
        <span class="v151_223">It's not hard. Here is a picture of the dish in the movie. Is there any music you'd like to listen to while eating?</span>
        <span class="v151_224">I would also like to recommend a dish in this film for you: pumpkin soup. As the weather in Melbourne is dry and windy, this dish will moisturise your throat and warm your body.</span>
        <span class="v151_225">What do you think?</span>
        <span class="v151_226">Yes! You are so uncanny!</span>
        <span class="v151_228">Hello! My name is Bee. I'm from the Digital Kingdom. I can gather nectar from flowers everywhere, and as your AI assistant, I can also gather inspiration for all kinds of food and brew up novel recipes. Although I don't need to eat, I know a lot about food in the human world.</span>

        <div class="v151_230"></div>
        <span class="v151_231">Yes, I feel very uncomfortable with the windy air in Melbourne. It makes me very cold, and the dry weather makes my throat hoarse.</span>
        <span class="v151_232">Ohhh! How do you know that?! I've been dying to cook this one of these days.</span>

        <span class="v151_250">Understood! Here's the music list. Please choose the light music you like. Then you can start cooking！</span>
        <span class="v151_251">I recommended the food last time, did you like it?</span>

        <span class="v151_253">Thank you! I will bookmark this cuisine to your favourite recipes.</span>
        <span class="v151_254">Excellent！</span>
