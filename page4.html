            <span class="v0_301">
                a. Prepare ingredients: Chop pumpkin, onion, sweet potato, garlic, cut herring.<br>
                b. Sauté vegetables and fish: Lightly spray the bottom of the pan with olive oil spray to soften the onion and garlic. Add the pumpkin and sweet potato and sauté until slightly softened. Then add the cubed herring and sauté slightly.<br>
                c. Make the sauce: In a small saucepan, combine the low-fat Greek yoghurt with the wholemeal flour and heat slowly to create a light sauce. If desired, add a small amount of low-fat cheese for extra flavour.<br>
                d. Assemble the pie: Lay the wholemeal pie crust in a pie dish and pour over the sautéed vegetables and herring mixture. Top with the prepared Greek yoghurt sauce, beat the eggs and pour them evenly into the mixture. Finish with a sprinkling of low-fat cheese.<br>
                e. Bake: Preheat the oven to 180°C, place the pie in the oven and bake for 30-40 minutes until the crust is golden brown and the filling is set.

            <span class="v0_320">
                a. Prepare ingredients: Cut butternut squash, onions, carrots, and garlic.<br>
                b. Sauté vegetables: Use olive oil spray to lightly coat the bottom of the pan, avoiding using too much oil. Soften the onion and garlic, add the carrots and squash and continue to sauté.<br>
                c. Cook the soup: Pour in the low-sodium vegetable stock and cook until the vegetables are tender.<br>
                d. Puree: Use a blender or handheld mixer to puree the cooked soup into a smooth paste.<br>
                e. Add Greek yoghurt: Add two tablespoons of Greek yoghurt to the soup and gently stir to combine. The Greek yoghurt will add to the soup's richness while keeping it low in fat.<br>
                f. Season and enjoy: Add salt and pepper to taste and finish with fresh herbs for flavour.
